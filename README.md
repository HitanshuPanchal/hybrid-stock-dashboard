# 📈 Hybrid Stock Prediction Dashboard

A deep learning-powered stock forecasting system that combines:

- 🔹 LSTM for stock price prediction  
- 🔹 ANN-based sentiment analysis  
- 🔹 OCR for news image text extraction  

This project integrates technical indicators, time-series modeling, and NLP to generate intelligent **BUY / SELL / HOLD** trading signals.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This system predicts stock prices using a **multivariate LSTM model** trained on historical market data and technical indicators.  

It enhances prediction accuracy by incorporating **news sentiment analysis**, extracted either from typed text or uploaded news images using OCR.

The final trading signal is generated using a hybrid approach:

- 📊 70% Price Prediction  
- 📰 30% Sentiment Score

## 🧠 Model Architecture

### 🔹 LSTM Price Prediction Model

- Input: 60 days × 9 features  
- Features used:
  - Open
  - High
  - Low
  - Close
  - Volume
  - MA20
  - RSI
  - MACD
  - Signal Line

- Two stacked LSTM layers (64 units each)
- Dense output layer (Regression)

The model captures both short-term fluctuations and long-term trends.

---

### 🔹 Sentiment Analysis Model

- Embedding Layer
- Dropout Regularization
- Global Average Pooling
- Dense Layers
- Sigmoid Output (0–1 probability)

Sentiment classification logic:
- Greater than  0.6 → Positive
- Less than 0.4 → Negative
- Otherwise → Neutral

---

## 📊 Hybrid Trading Logic

The final signal is calculated using:

price_change = (predicted_price - actual_price) / actual_price * 100
combined_score = 0.7 * price_change + 0.3 * sentiment_probability


| Combined Score | Trading Signal |
|---------------|---------------|
| > 0.2         | BUY           |
| < -0.2        | SELL          |
| Otherwise     | HOLD          |

This prevents over-trading due to small fluctuations.
